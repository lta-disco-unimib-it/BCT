This is Behavior Capture and Test (BCT), a dynamic analysis toolset to support program understanding and debugging.
  
This repository contains the sources of the BCT library.
It also includes the sources of kBehavior library.
To use BCT to monitor programs please also donwload one of its main interfaces:
* BCT_CONSOLE_TOOLS, to use it from the command line
* BCT_ECLIPSE_PLUGIN, to use it within Eclipse


BCT has been described in detail in the following publications:

* Leonardo Mariani, Fabrizio Pastore, Mauro Pezzè:
Dynamic Analysis for Diagnosing Integration Faults. IEEE Trans. Software Eng. 37(4): 486-508 (2011)

* Leonardo Mariani, Fabrizio Pastore, Mauro Pezzè: A toolset for automated failure analysis. ICSE 2009: 563-566

* Leonardo Mariani, Mauro Pezzè:
Dynamic Detection of COTS Component Incompatibility. IEEE Software 24(5): 76-85 (2007)

* L. Mariani and M. Pezze`, “Behavior capture and test: automated analysis
of component integration,” in proceedings on the 10th International Con- ference on Engineering Complex Computer Systems. IEEE Computer Society, 2005, pp. 292–301.

The project can be compiled using Apache ANT.
